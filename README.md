# HomeChoice UI
The frontend for the HomeChoice real estate management system, built with Angular.

## Development Server
- **Start the server**: Run `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload when files change.
- **Run the project**: Use `ng run` to execute the application.

## Technologies Used
- **Angular**: Framework for building the frontend application.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure token-based authentication.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for designing user interfaces.
- **Bootstrap**: A popular CSS framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites.

## Folder Structure
The folder structure is based on **domains and functionality**, designed to make the codebase modular and maintainable. This organization allows each feature or domain to be self-contained and easier to work on independently.

You can check the [Angular Folder Structure Reference](https://angular.dev/reference/configs/file-structure) for more details on Angular's recommended file organization.
